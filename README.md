# EDA-Global-Terrorism
This project presents an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of global terrorism patterns using the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). 

The analysis delves into various aspects of terrorist incidents, including temporal trends, geographical distribution, attack methods, target types, weapon usage, casualty counts, and more. Through visualizations and statistical summaries, the project aims to uncover insights into the dynamics of terrorism over time and across different regions.

Key Highlights:

Comprehensive examination of over 180,000 terrorist attacks recorded in the GTD.
Identification of temporal trends, such as fluctuations in the frequency of attacks and casualty rates over the years.
Analysis of geographical hotspots and visualization of terrorism distribution using heatmaps and choropleth maps.
Exploration of attack methods, including the prevalence of bombings, armed assaults, and other tactics.
Examination of target types to understand the most frequently targeted sectors and demographics.
Assessment of weapon usage, highlighting the types of weapons commonly employed in terrorist activities.
Specific focus on terrorism in India, including trends, target types, weapon usage, and geographic distribution of incidents.
Evaluation of terrorist groups responsible for the attacks, including known organizations and local insurgent groups.
Insights into the motivations behind terrorist incidents, where available, through analysis of the motive variable.
Recommendations for addressing the business objectives related to counter-terrorism efforts based on the analysis findings.
This EDA project provides valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders interested in understanding global terrorism trends and developing strategies to combat terrorist threats effectively. The code and visualizations are available in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook, facilitating reproducibility and further analysis.
